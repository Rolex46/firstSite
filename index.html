    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>I know you have heard that the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. But this has been no ordinary journey. There was no room for single steps, lest you be left behind and certainly there was neither time to count. Right from the word go it had to be strides, long ones for that matter. I am talking of Moringa School, because that is where this chapter begins. I am not complaining, I mean look at me, a newbie tech that could make their first website at one week.It has not just been the education, it is the culture, the ethics, the discipline, the hardwork and most certainly the growth mindest I have acquired all through that makes the journey all the more worthwhile to me. Below is a sneak peek of my achievements so far</p>
